<PRE>&#65279;Hi,

just to be precise: Legally, we're talking about a &quot;Verein&quot; and not
about a foundation.

As I'm told, you need 7 members to set up a &quot;Verein&quot;, but only 3 to keep
it running. That means, there could be 4 part-time members until the
&quot;Verein&quot; is officially registered.

For the membership fee, that's a thing which has to be defined. For
example, the KDE project knows active members and extraordinary resp.
supporting members. Active members pay no membership fee but &quot;donate&quot;
their work. (For more details see
<A HREF="http://ev.kde.org/corporate/statutes.php.">http://ev.kde.org/corporate/statutes.php.</A>) I think that would be also a
good idea for DeepaMehta.

In my opinion J&#246;rg could be a member, even if he will be paid by the
&quot;Verein&quot;. I wouldn't take it as a good idea if he's in the board. But
that's my personal point of view. I'm no lawyer.

Regards,
Urs

&gt;<i> Dear DeepaMehta friends,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Urs and I have for the past 6 weeks been brainstorming about how to 
</I>&gt;<i> further DeepaMehta development, and Urs had the idea to set up a 
</I>&gt;<i> foundation (F&#246;rderverein). The foundation should ensure that the 
</I>&gt;<i> DeepaMehta project can develop side by side with the DeepaMehta GmbH. 
</I>&gt;<i> The immediate concern is to generate funds so that J&#246;rg (as main 
</I>&gt;<i> developer) and possibly other developers can work on the DeepaMehta 
</I>&gt;<i> project, while customer contracts could be taken on through the 
</I>&gt;<i> DeepaMehta GmbH. The foundation would be complementary to the GmbH as a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-profit organisation for people to make donations to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We welcome your suggestions and want to include you in our dialogue 
</I>&gt;<i> from now on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this correspondence the themes are 1) the set up of the foundation 
</I>&gt;<i> and 2) its focus, goals and tasks:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Foundation set up
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand it our foundation currently has three members: Andreas 
</I>&gt;<i> G., J&#246;rg, and Urs. A foundation needs at least 7 members.
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; I would hereby like to ask you if you would like to become a member 
</I>&gt;<i> and in particular Annette, Jurij, J&#252;rgen, Andreas W., Malte, and 
</I>&gt;<i> Enrico.
</I>&gt;<i> Question to you Urs, is,
</I>&gt;<i> a) does it cost them anything and if so, how much, to become a member?
</I>&gt;<i> b) is the membership paid once only or regularly, ie once a month.
</I>&gt;<i> Another question is, what do you suggest would be J&#246;rg's status and who 
</I>&gt;<i> would be president? Can J&#246;rg be a member if he is the main recipient of 
</I>&gt;<i> the generated funds?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Focus, Goals, Tasks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Focus: the immediate focus is to support the further and continual 
</I>&gt;<i> development of DeepaMehta.
</I>&gt;<i> (A future perspective for the foundation could be to encourage a 
</I>&gt;<i> interdisciplinary dialogue about the human-machine relationship 
</I>&gt;<i> i.e.organising symposiums.)
</I>&gt;<i> Goal: to have supporters and sponsors
</I>&gt;<i> Tasks: a) to find supporters b) marketing c) organisation.
</I>&gt;<i> Who would take on these tasks resp. would coordinate the people doing 
</I>&gt;<i> them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> J&#246;rg R.
