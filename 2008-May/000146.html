<PRE>Thanks for your fast reply, Thilo.
To paint real Blackboards on a ground cost 5 euros at all, then it is
hand made (black) and delivers a very nice eye-catcher for the visitor.
Even if we could use an &quot;external&quot; blackboard and hang it on the walls,
this would be painted directly on the background of the booth. in this
way we also could just re-write the contents within some topics of a
great map which structure is fixed but the contents are flexible. i
imagine this would reach over both walls from the bottom to the top of
the walls.

the discussion is opened, maybe we use the comments page from this

<A HREF="http://deepamehta.newthinking.net/wiki/en/Upcoming_Events">http://deepamehta.newthinking.net/wiki/en/Upcoming_Events</A>

maybe then we all could get clearer about where your headline is aiming
to and what you mean with &quot;semantic&quot; web and witchery ;)

cheers,

malte

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organization team and that really makes me sad somehow even if we will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do our best and can make a good impact with a nice booth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We already missed the Booth Workshop at the 1st of February and the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of April. Today is the 9th May and we normally should have filled out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the requiprostred profile information until the 13th of April which is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as you may guess, impossible!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding to the 2nd Infomail for the participants we are currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking over an xp-style-booth idea for the deepamehta space, which we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to clearify until sunday and which will be opened up for everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until 16:00pm off sunday for your suggestions, ideas and possible support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The deadline for ordering the Exhibitors Passes is also on Sunday (11th
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  May), which means that we are not flexible anymore with choosing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants who will represent us at our booth! We have to make these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions urgently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To deliver suggestions for a deepamehta workshop, within provided
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workshop rooms, is also gone already. I think we should focus on our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space there (6 sqm, maybe on the corner with two open sides, 2 chairs,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power supply, network connectiona and a table ;) )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be happy to think with you together until Sunday afternoon, how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our presentation could look like and whom will represent us at the icc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messe in berlin from the 28th until the 31st of May. This is the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing we can do now to take this great chance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want to paint the walls of the booth and provide a blackboard for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> teaching deepamehta lessons :) this idea would cost around 100 euros for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> materials which we would have to collect somehow and i think it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an eye-catcher in our own style.
</I>&gt;<i>
