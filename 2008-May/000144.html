<PRE>Hey together!

Since we are accepted at the LinuxTag to present us, the DeepaMehta
Community with an own both, it`s a pity that we were informed about this
effort just a few days ago. I am just reading the info mailings from the
organization team and that really makes me sad somehow even if we will
do our best and can make a good impact with a nice booth.

We already missed the Booth Workshop at the 1st of February and the
Deadline for our own sketches of the 6square meters passed by at the 9th
of April. Today is the 9th May and we normally should have filled out
all the required profile information until the 13th of April which is,
as you may guess, impossible!

Regarding to the 2nd Infomail for the participants we are currently
thinking over an xp-style-booth idea for the deepamehta space, which we
want to clearify until sunday and which will be opened up for everyone
until 16:00pm off sunday for your suggestions, ideas and possible support.

The deadline for ordering the Exhibitors Passes is also on Sunday (11th
 May), which means that we are not flexible anymore with choosing the
participants who will represent us at our booth! We have to make these
decisions urgently.

To deliver suggestions for a deepamehta workshop, within provided
workshop rooms, is also gone already. I think we should focus on our
space there (6 sqm, maybe on the corner with two open sides, 2 chairs,
power supply, network connectiona and a table ;) )

I would be happy to think with you together until Sunday afternoon, how
our presentation could look like and whom will represent us at the icc
messe in berlin from the 28th until the 31st of May. This is the only
thing we can do now to take this great chance.

I want to paint the walls of the booth and provide a blackboard for
teaching deepamehta lessons :) this idea would cost around 100 euros for
materials which we would have to collect somehow and i think it would be
an eye-catcher in our own style.

Sunny greetings,

Malte
