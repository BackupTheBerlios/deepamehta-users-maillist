Einrechungen oder Teilnahme von Euch sind nat&#252;rlich ganz besonders willkommen.
Achtung: Die Einreichungs-Deadline ist schon am 13. Juni...

Liebe Gr&#252;&#223;e - Heiko

*** Call for papers: 2nd workshop on Personal Knowledge Management 
*** at Mensch und Computer 2010, September 12, Duisburg, Germany 
*** <A HREF="http://2010.personalknowledge.org/">http://2010.personalknowledge.org/</A> 


==Personal Knowledge Management Workshop==
Understanding, Supporting, and Evaluating the Management of Personal Knowledge, Information and Data

Many of the large problems facing the world today (e.g. global warming, the economic crisis, energy generation) are so complex that the individuals trying to solve these problems have to deal with large quantities of cross-domain knowledge, information and data. Not only in such complex domains, but in knowledge-intensive activities in general, it is crucial to support the user in managing his/her personal knowledge and information in an appropriate way. Reflecting this, understanding and supporting these management activities has become a popular research focus in several academic communities.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together a broad range of researchers with the goal of fostering collaborations and addressing the challenges faced when studying and supporting the management of personal knowledge, information and data. The intention is to increase awareness of the work that is being done in the other communities and to establish a means to bridge the gaps caused by different approaches and literature in the different research domains. 

To achieve this we facilitate a highly interactive workshop and encourage presentation and participation from researchers from any background interested in understanding and supporting the management of personal knowledge, information and data.

The topics of the workshop include but are not limited to:

* Understanding PKM behaviour
* Studies investigating these behaviours or specific aspects (e.g. emotional or psychological)
* Theoretical models of behaviour
* Philosophical perspectives on behaviour
* Contributions towards supporting PKM behaviour
* Interfaces, Tools and Systems, Frameworks etc.
* Methods allowing the investigation or evaluation of behaviour and tools
* Novel user study methods, log analyses, theoretical approaches etc.

==Submission Guidelines==
Short papers (max 4 pages) and short position papers (max 2 pages) describing significant work in progress, late breaking results or (ideas / challenges for the domain) are invited. Submissions should be in the LNI style ( <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/lni2005">http://tinyurl.com/lni2005</A> )

Anonymised papers in pdf format should be submitted to <A HREF="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pkm2010">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pkm2010</A> no later than midnight Pacific Daylight Time on June 13, 2010. Submissions will be subject to double-blind reviewing.  Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings.

==Important Dates==
June 13, 2010 (Sun.) Deadline for paper submission
July 4, 2010 (Sun.)    Notification to authors
July 14, 2010 (Wed.)  Camera-ready copy due
September 12 or 15, 2010  Workshop (final date will be announced soon on the website)

==Background==

The Previous PKM Workshop

At the first workshop on Personal Knowledge Management that was held as part of the Knowledge Management Conference KM2009 in Solothurn, it was discovered that in fact scholars from domains as diverse as economics, knowledge management, computer science, HCI, psychology, library- and information science are working in similar problem spaces, but are using different methods, terminology, literature etc. and are mostly working without knowledge of the other communities. The workshop&#8217;s main achievement was to establish that these different groups are facing the same challenges and to acknowledge that the approaches taken and results achieved by the various communities are beneficial to the other groups. At PKM2009 the following core issues came to attention:
* Media: digital vs. paper-based methods
* Scope: personal perspective vs. management towards group
* Philosophy: Is it possible to manage knowledge by means of information technology and how can this be best achieved?
* Evaluation: How can the performance of PKM methods be measured, both scientifically and economically?
Involving the HCI Community

While last year the breadth and importance of the field became apparent, and many technological tools and approaches were discussed, only little progress could be made towards concrete results and conclusions. It became evident that especially a human factors perspective would be valuable to progressing the field, as it expressly addresses the interrelation between technology and human behaviour.
The aim of this follow-up workshop is to bring together a broad range of researchers from all of the above fields with the goal of fostering collaborations and addressing the challenges faced when studying and supporting the management of personal knowledge, information and data. The intention is to increase awareness of the work that is being done in the other communities and to establish a means to bridge the gaps caused by different approaches and literature in the different research domains.
To achieve this we will explicitly encourage presentation and participation from both German- and international -based researchers in the fields of human-computer interaction, computer science, psychology, business and economics, knowledge management, information retrieval, library and information science and any other related area. To that end, our interdisciplinary group of co-chairs, who have backgrounds and contacts in these fields, has assembled a broad -but nevertheless high quality - program committee from the communities outlined above.


==Preliminary Schedule==
The workshop will be structured to encourage group discussion and active collaboration among attendees. Therefore only the most suitable of the accepted papers will be presented via short talks. The rest will be presented during a poster session.
* Welcome, and interactive introductions
* Keynote (TBA)
* Paper session (three slots 15 minute each including discussion)
* Brainstorm several topics for breakout group discussion
* Breakout groups discussion (encouraged to continue over lunch)
* Breakout groups report back, with group discussion
* Poster session
* Rapporteur summaries, Wrap-up and Roadmap of future directions
* Workshop Dinner
