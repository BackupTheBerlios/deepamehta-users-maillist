Hi,

on July 28, 2011 DeepaMehta 4.0.1 has been released.

This release fixes a bug: when editing an association (e.g. retyping) the role types are not compromised.

Thanks Malte for reporting!

You can update a 4.0 installation while keeping your content, however a 4.0.1 clean install is recommended (see note below).
See the README for update instructions (scroll down).

--------------------

Technical note 1:

In DeepaMehta 4.0.1 the data model has slightly changed: Topic types are never used as role types anymore. Instead the new role type &quot;Default&quot; is used. The existing 4.0 type definitions in the DB are not migrated. However, the 4.0.1 application code is compatible with the 4.0 model.

Affected are the following association semantics:
    - Core: data type assignment of a topic/association type
    - Core: index mode assignment of a topic/association type
    - Topicmaps: topic/association assignments of a topicmap
    - Workspaces: topic/type assignments of a workspace

CAUTION when editing such an association that was created with 4.0:
In this situation you must set role type &quot;Default&quot; manually for the correct association end.
Otherwise the respective association gets corrupted.

For associations newly created in 4.0.1 there is no issue.


Technical note 2:

These 3rd party components are updated in 4.0.1:
- Jersey 1.5 -&gt; 1.8
- Jettison 1.2 -&gt; 1.3
- Neo4j Mehtagraph 0.7 -&gt; 0.8
