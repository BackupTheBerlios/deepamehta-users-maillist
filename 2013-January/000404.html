<PRE>
A happy new year for everyone!

Here I like to provide you with some planning updates about the upcoming DM 4.0.14 and 4.1 releases. In short:
4.0.14:
	- main focus is PERFORMANCE through a new storage layer.
	- planned for Jan 2013
4.1:
	- main focus is CONSOLIDATION as a basis for developer documentation.
	- first release with an UPGRADE guarantee for your data.
	- planned for Feb 2013
	
Some background: experience with amounts of real user data (in the EduZEN and Poemspace installations) revealed serious performance problems. In the field of graph DBs the underlying problem is known as the Supernode Problem. Supernodes are those with thousands (or more) of edges and are true performance blockers for the naive traversal approach. In DM supernodes are e.g. Types and Workspaces. The solution to the Supernode problem is to maintain an additional index for the edges.

DM 4.0.14 will come with a completely rewritten storage layer. On the one hand, to fight the Supernode problem, more sophisticated Lucene indexes will be maintained, in particular for the Association metadata (and for Association user data as well). On the other hand DM 4.0.14 will be ready for 3rd-party developers to provide additional storage implementations. That is, DM will not strictly rely on Neo4j anymore but alternative DBs can be plugged in as well.

The focus of DM 4.1 is not new features but consolidation. One aim is to provide a rather stable development basis that is ready for being documented. While writing documentation it happens that certain things seem difficult to explain. Often this is a sign for bad design or just bad wording (class names etc.). In DM 4.1 we try to anticipate these situations and fix them. Furthermore, the time between 4.0.14 and 4.1 gives us the opportunity to make experience with the new storage layer, and to possibly apply minor corrections.

Most important for the user: DM 4.1 will be the first DM 4 release that comes with an upgrade guarantee for your data. That is, you can put real data in while being sure it can be used in future DM 4 releases.
